# Kanakku (கணக்கு)

**A free income & expense book for everyone** — self-employed people, small shopkeepers and homemakers.

Made by an ordinary middle-class man who wanted a simple, honest way to keep accounts. No ads. No sign-up. No servers. **Your data never leaves your phone** unless you back it up yourself. The optional AI advisor sends only a short summary of totals (no names or notes) after you sign in with a free Puter account.

## தமிழில்
கணக்கு — அனைவருக்கும் இலவசம். சுயதொழில் செய்வோர், சிறு கடைக்காரர்கள், இல்லத்தரசிகள் வரவு-செலவை எளிமையாக எழுத ஒரு சாதாரண நடுத்தரக் குடும்பத்து மனிதரால் உருவாக்கப்பட்டது. விளம்பரம் இல்லை, பதிவு இல்லை, உங்கள் தரவு உங்கள் போனிலேயே.

## Install on your phone
Open the live link in Chrome and tap **Install app** (or Menu → *Add to Home screen*).

## Your data
Everything is stored in your browser's local storage on your device. Clearing browser data erases it, so use **Data → Backup to Gmail** regularly (the app reminds you every 30 days).

## Google Drive backup setup (one time)
1. In Google Cloud Console create a project and enable the **Google Drive API**.
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen (External, Testing) and add your own Google account as a test user.
3. Create an **OAuth client ID** of type **Web application** and add `https://<your-username>.github.io` as an authorized JavaScript origin.
4. Paste the Client ID into **More → Backup & Settings → Google Drive backup**.

## Privacy
Entries, budgets and udhaar stay on your device. Nothing is sent anywhere unless you back up (Gmail / Drive), use voice entry (your browser's speech service) or use the AI tab, which sends only category totals to Puter after you sign in. No ads, no tracking.

## Deploy your own copy
It is plain static files (`index.html`, `sw.js`, `manifest.json`, icons). Push to a GitHub repo and enable **Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → main / root**.

## Roadmap
Push notifications that need a server, more languages, a shared book for couples

## Feedback
Open an issue on this repository — suggestions and Tamil wording fixes are very welcome.

## v4l — redesign
Peacock/kumkum palette (WCAG AA checked, light+dark), balance hero with spent-of-income bar, ranked category bars instead of a donut, floating glass bottom nav (glass only on navigation, with reduced-transparency fallback), SVG icons, large amount entry with sticky Save, 44–48px touch targets, focus rings, reduced-motion support.
