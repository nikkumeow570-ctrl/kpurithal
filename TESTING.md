# Kanakku — manual test checklist (run on a real phone before sharing)

Automated checks (33) cover the logic only. These need a human and a phone.

## P0 — must pass
1. Install: open the live link in Chrome, tap **Install app**; icon shows the Tamil க; opens full-screen.
2. Offline: turn on airplane mode, open the app; entries still show and you can add one.
3. Add income and expense (with paise, e.g. 1234.50); Home totals and "Net this month" match by hand.
4. Edit and delete an entry; **Undo** restores it in the same place.
5. Android **Back** button goes History → Home, and only exits from Home.
6. Backup to Gmail: file arrives; **Erase all data**; import the file; everything returns.
7. Language toggle: every screen in Tamil, no cut-off text, ₹ amounts correct.
8. PIN: set, close the app for 1+ minute, reopen → asks for PIN; wrong PIN is refused; PIN digits are hidden.
9. Two windows: open the app and the browser tab; add an entry in one; the other shows it after you switch back.
10. Update: after pushing a new version, the "New version ready — Reload" bar appears.

## P1 — should pass
11. Recurring: add one for today; it appears once, and not again after reopening.
12. Udhaar: add, part-pay, mark settled; totals update.
13. Monthly report: check the numbers, then **Save as PDF** — Tamil text is readable, no menus in the PDF.
14. Voice (Chrome): say "milk 60" and "பால் ஐநூறு"; the form fills but does not save by itself.
15. Calendar reminder: add it, then see it ring with the app closed.
16. Drive: paste your Client ID, back up, restore (one-time setup in the README).
17. Insights (needs ~2 months of entries): Home shows the month-end outlook; More → Insights opens; "Remove duplicate" and "Make recurring" work and can be undone/deleted.
18. Type a note you used before (e.g. "milk"): a category/amount hint appears; tapping it fills the form.
19. Also try: Samsung Internet, an iPhone (Add to Home Screen), a low-end Android, large font size in phone settings.

## Known limits (by design)
Data lives on each phone only; the PIN is a screen lock, not encryption; background reminders are best-effort; no sync between phones.
